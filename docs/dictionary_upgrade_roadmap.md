# Dictionary Upgrade Roadmap

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the dictionary upgrade implementation for the Lettris Flutter game. The work is organized into phases for easier planning and implementation.

## Phase 2: Core Dictionary Implementation

### 1. Expanded Dictionary Data
- [ ] Create a more comprehensive word list (beyond the current words.txt)
- [ ] Implement a compressed dictionary format (JSON with frequency data)
- [ ] Add multiple dictionary sources (core, extended, user-discovered)
- [ ] Create a mechanism to merge and prioritize words from different sources

### 2. Multi-tier Dictionary Loading
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for the extended dictionary
- [ ] Add priority levels for different dictionary sources
- [ ] Create background loading process for extended dictionaries
- [ ] Implement incremental updates for dictionary data

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### 1. Word Difficulty Ratings
- [ ] Implement scoring based on word frequency/rarity
- [ ] Add difficulty levels for game mechanics
- [ ] Create a scoring system that rewards rarer words
- [ ] Develop a player skill rating based on word difficulty

### 2. Word Suggestion System
- [ ] Create a hint system based on available letters
- [ ] Implement algorithms to suggest possible words
- [ ] Add configurable difficulty for hints
- [ ] Create a "challenge word" system for gameplay

### 3. Analytics Enhancement
- [ ] Track most commonly used words
- [ ] Add statistical analysis of player word patterns
- [ ] Implement learning algorithms to improve word suggestions
- [ ] Create player-specific word recommendations

## Phase 4: UI and User Experience

### 1. Dictionary Management UI
- [ ] Add dictionary selection options
- [ ] Create settings for managing dictionary preferences
- [ ] Implement dictionary download progress indicators
- [ ] Add language selection for multilingual support (future)

### 2. Word Collection Features
- [ ] Add word collection achievements
- [ ] Implement "words discovered" tracking
- [ ] Create themed word collections
- [ ] Develop a player dictionary for discovered words

### 3. Enhanced Word Display
- [ ] Add word definitions on long-press (optional API integration)
- [ ] Implement category tags for words
- [ ] Add visual indicators for word rarity/difficulty
- [ ] Create special effects for rare or long words

## Phase 5: Optimization and Cleanup

### 1. Performance Tuning
- [ ] Optimize database schema and indices
- [ ] Implement batch processing for large dictionary operations
- [ ] Add database compaction and maintenance routines
- [ ] Create efficient memory management for large dictionaries

### 2. Extended Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for dictionary functions
- [ ] Implement stress tests for large dictionaries
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test on low-end devices for optimization

### 3. Code Cleanup and Documentation
- [ ] Refactor and organize dictionary code
- [ ] Add detailed documentation
- [ ] Create maintenance guidelines
- [ ] Develop API documentation for future extensions

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Complete Phase 2 to ensure a robust core dictionary system
2. Implement Word Difficulty Ratings from Phase 3 for improved gameplay
3. Add Dictionary Management UI from Phase 4 for better user control
4. Focus on Performance Tuning from Phase 5 before adding more features

### Performance Considerations
- Dictionary loading should not block game startup
- Word validation must be fast (<5ms) for smooth gameplay
- Memory usage should be optimized for mobile devices
- Consider using platform channels for native SQLite access if needed

### User Experience Guidelines
- Dictionary operations should be transparent to the user
- Provide visual feedback for dictionary-related processes
- Keep the interface simple while adding powerful features
- Ensure word validation feels responsive and accurate
